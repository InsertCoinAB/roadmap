# GWEN public roadmap

:sparkle: View the [official GWEN public product roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/InsertCoinAB/projects/3)

Our product roadmap is where you can learn about what features we're working on, what stage they're in, and when we expect to bring them to you.

The roadmap repository is for communicating GWEN's roadmap.

## Guide to the roadmap

Every item on the roadmap is an issue, with labels indicating some of the following:

- A <span style="color:#0E8A16">**release phase**</span> that describes the next expected phase of the roadmap item. See below for a guide to release phases.

- A <span style="color:#5319E7">**feature**</span> that indicates the feature to which the item belongs.

- A <span style="color:#B60205">**module**</span> that indicates the module to which the item belongs.

- Once a feature is delivered, the issue will be closed.

## Release phases

Release phases indicate the stages that the product or feature goes through, from early testing to general availability.

- <span style="color:#0E8A16">**alpha:**</span> _Primarily for testing and feedback_\
  Limited availability. Features still under heavy development, and subject to change. Not for production use, and no documentation, SLAs or support provided.

- <span style="color:#0E8A16">**beta:**</span> _Publicly available in full or limited capacity_\
  Features mostly complete and documented. Timeline and requirements for GA usually published. No SLAs or support provided.

- <span style="color:#0E8A16">**ga:**</span> _Generally available to all customers_\
  Ready for production use with associated SLA and technical support obligations. Approximately 1-2 quarters from Beta.

Some of our features may still be in the exploratory stages, and have no timeframe available. These are included in the roadmap only for early feedback. These are marked as follows:

- <span style="color:#0E8A16">**in design:**</span>\
  Feature in discovery phase. We have decided to build this feature, but are still figuring out _how_.

- <span style="color:#0E8A16">**exploring:**</span>\
  Feature under consideration. We are considering building this feature, and gathering feedback on it.
